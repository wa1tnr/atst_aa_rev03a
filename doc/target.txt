Adafruit Metro M0 using GPIO D6 and D7 to talk to
Pimoroni Blinkt module (an APA102 array x8 RGB LEDs).

This is untested on 29 September 2019, and is inferred
from two facts:

 * The Metro M0 is still connected to the Blinkt,
   in a current project

 * Firmware developed in September 2019 (a day
   or two ago) in the Arduino IDE, modeled on
   this very repository, runs fine.

Hadn't noticed ../current_targets when this was written.

Good sanity check. ;) 29 September 2019
