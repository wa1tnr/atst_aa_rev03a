November 2019 update:

Tested.  It's the same physical project (Metro M0 Express
with Pimoroni Blinkt on D6 D7).

Works fine (15 Nov 2019) in this AtmelStart based program,
which is stored in this repository:

    https://github.com/wa1tnr/atst_aa_rev03a.git

in branch:
    testing-ee-aa-

and modified on 15 November 2019 (trivial color mod stored as
another variant of main.c here).

Seems to run at 1 mhz CPU freq (OSC8M).

See ../config/hpl_gclk_config.h

Adafruit Metro M0 using GPIO D6 and D7 to talk to
Pimoroni Blinkt module (an APA102 array x8 RGB LEDs).

This is untested on 29 September 2019, and is inferred
from two facts:

 * The Metro M0 is still connected to the Blinkt,
   in a current project

 * Firmware developed in September 2019 (a day
   or two ago) in the Arduino IDE, modeled on
   this very repository, runs fine.

Hadn't noticed ../current_targets when this was written.

Good sanity check. ;) 29 September 2019
